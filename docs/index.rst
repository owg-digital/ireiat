Welcome to IREIAT's documentation!
==================================

The Intermodal Routing and Environmental Impact Analysis Tool (IREIAT) is meant to enable its target user group,
infrastructure planners, to understand:

1. Expected flows on the US intermodal freight network given demand, intermodal costs (both direct financial and other
   costs), and network capacities
2. How cost, transit time, disruptions/resilience, and GHG emissions affect freight flows across the current and
   future intermodal network
