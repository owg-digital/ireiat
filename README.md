# Purpose

WIP

# Quick start

The tool is meant to be a Python-based command line tool, so you should ensure
that you have Python 3.11 installed on your machine, which
can be downloaded [here](!https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3117/).

Once you have Python installed you should be able to install the package
with `pip install ireiat`. After which, you can just run `ireiat` from a command-line!

Run `ireiat --help` for CLI options or see the full documentation (WIP, not yet released)
